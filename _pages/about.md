Hi! Iâ€™m Thanh (or Thomas), a researcher engineer at [SOAR (SOftware Analytic Research)](https://soarsmu.github.io/), [Singapore Management University](https://smu.edu.sg/), advised by [Prof. David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/). I graduated from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://soict.hust.edu.vn/) with a Information Technology Bachelor's degree.
Before joining SMU, I was an research assistant at [BK.AI Intelligent Software Engineering Lab](https://bkai.ai/research/intelligent-software-engineering/), under the supervision of [Prof. Huynh Quyet Thang](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/thanghq/). Next year, I will join [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) as a Ph.D Student under the advisor of [Dr. Bach Le](https://xuanbachle.github.io/) and [Prof. Toby Murray](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tobym/). 

**Research:** My research interests are improving developer productivity by designing automatic ways of software debugging. In particular, I want to create novel techniques to support developer in detection, localization and repair of bug/vulnerabilities. Currently, I am focusing on robust and trustworthy automated program repair.
